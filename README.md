Escher's Arena is a prototype for a non-Euclidean first person perspective game, made with ![Unity](https://unity.com/). 

The unique concept is that a player will be able to walk on walls and ceilings without ever leaving the ground. This is achieved via "portals" built into
the levels which will transport the player elsewhere, similar to the popular video game ![Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)).
The key difference between the portals in this game/prototype to other games that employee a similar technique is that an object's gravity will rotate 
based on the orientation of the entrance and exit portals, which can make ceilings become floors as shown in the following clip where an orange ball rolling along the ground will be on the ceiling in the room on the left.

Future plans are to turn this idea into a multiplayer first person shooter.
